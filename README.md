# exposome_outcomewide

As an online companion to the manuscript "Beyond the single-outcome approach: a comparison of outcome-wide analysis methods for exposome research" by Anguita-Ruiz et al. (2023), we have created this GitHub repository where we provide **scripts** and a **simulated multivariate dataset** for running **outcome-wide analysis**. 

Outcome-wide analysis can offer several benefits, including increased power to detect weak signals and the ability to identify exposures with multiple effects on health, which may be good targets for preventive measures. Recently, advanced statistical multivariate techniques for outcome-wide analysis have been developed, but they have been rarely applied to exposome analysis. In this work, we provide an overview of six methods that are well-suited for outcome-wide exposome analysis and are implemented in the R statistical software. The identified methods can be grouped into four main categories: regularized multivariate regression techniques, multi-task learning approaches, dimensionality reduction approaches, and Bayesian extensions of the multivariate regression framework.  

In **this repository**, we cover all required steps for applying these techniques; including data standardization, model parameters calibration, output curation strategies and visualization.
