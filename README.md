# exposome_outcomewide
 This is an online companion to the manuscript "BEYOND THE SINGLE-OUTCOME APPROACH: AN OVERVIEW OF OUTCOME-WIDE ANALYSIS METHODS FOR EXPOSOME RESEARCH" by Anguita-Ruiz et al (2023). In this repository, we provide codes and scripts to run the different outcome-wide analysis models reviewed and discussed in the paper. For that, we use a simulated multivariate dataset.
